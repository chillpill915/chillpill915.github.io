Come one come all. As a digital man I thought i needed a digital body of work so here it goes.

My name is Carter Hill and this is my website. This will serve as a public home for my thoughts and things i find interesting. I'll keep things as simple as possible and just post occassionaly. This is not really meant to be a social media outlet but simply a place to exist.
