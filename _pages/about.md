<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Come one come all. As a digital man I thought i needed a digital body of work so here it goes.

My Name is Carter Hill and this is my website. This will serve as a public home for my thoughts and things i find interesting. I'll keep things as simple as possible and just post occassionaly. This is not really meant to be a social media outlet but you can reach me at [my email](mailto:carterhill915@gmail.com).
