Thank you for your services
dearest spirit, whether
you lie cast and sprawled
away, wearily of the tasks you 
abide.

What takes a man out of his sleep?
should i thank you again?

Walk with me beyond the crows
silluoutted along your path
and bare the silence around the bend
speak of death without reason.
Walk with me and take me
from this restful place.
