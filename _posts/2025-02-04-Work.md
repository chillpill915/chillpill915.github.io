"There is no such thing as writers block, you just hate your ideas."

I'm paraphrasing a quote from Jerry Seinfeld that i thought was insightful. More insightful than his entire comedic career. Don't worry, i love Seinfeld, but his standup is the worst part of the show.

The mind is always running and thinking to itself. Atleast mine is never completely quiet. The thoughts just seem uninteresting. The room is too hot, why does my head itch, what time is it. A pit of uselessness when it comes to writing for the most part. Like all things, you become better by doing. 

I've attempted to keep a journal of sorts for the most part of my adult life and I think its the only thing thats kept me from spiraling into an abyss of dullness. The journal's full of garbage. When i look back at my writing i tend to hate the majority of it. I put forth hundreds of lines and pages over the years just to come up with a few lines here or there that seem a little interesting or funny. You could say those are poor results, but im still happy with the little i've come up with. I think putting the words down are just the first step. After you take the step theres just a hope that something good will come out of it.
